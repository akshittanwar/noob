The history of anime can be traced back to the start of the 20th century, with the earliest verifiable films dating from 1906
 Before the advent of film, Japan already had a rich tradition of entertainment with colourful painted figures moving across the projection screen in 写し絵 (Utushi-e), a particular Japanese type of magic lantern show popular in the 19th century
 Possibly inspired by European phantasmagoria shows, utushi-e showmen used mechanical slides and developed lightweight wooden projectors (furo) that were handheld so that several performers could each control the motions of different projected figures
The first generation of animators in the late 1910s included Ōten Shimokawa, Jun'ichi Kōuchi and Seitaro Kitayama, commonly referred to as the "fathers" of anime
 Propaganda films, such as Momotarō no Umiwashi (1943) and Momotarō: Umi no Shinpei (1945), the latter being the first anime feature film, were made during World War II

The history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s, when academic computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations as part of their research or just for recreation

 During the 1970s, anime developed further, with the inspiration of Disney animators, separating itself from its Western roots, and developing distinct genres such as mecha and its super robot subgenre
 Typical shows from this period include Astro Boy, Lupin III and Mazinger Z
 During this period several filmmakers became famous, especially Hayao Miyazaki and Mamoru Oshii
 In the 1980s, anime became mainstream in Japan, experiencing a boom in production with the rise in popularity of anime like Gundam, Macross, Dragon Ball, and genres such as real robot, space opera and cyberpunk
 Space Battleship Yamato and The Super Dimension Fortress Macross also achieved worldwide success after being adapted respectively as Star Blazers and Robotech 
==========
  These games were played on computers such as the IBM 1560, and moves were made by means of punch cards
  Video gaming did not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s, when video arcade games and gaming consoles using joysticks, buttons, and other controllers, along with graphics on computer screens and home computer games were introduced to the general public
 Since the 1980s, video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of modern popular culture in most parts of the world
 One of the early games was Spacewar!, which was developed by computer scientists
 Early arcade video games developed from 1972 to 1978

 The film Akira set records in 1988 for the production costs of an anime film and went on to become an international success, with a live action edition planned for 2021
 Later, in 2004, the same creators produced Steamboy, which took over as the most expensive anime film
 Spirited Away shared the first prize at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival and won the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, while Innocence: Ghost in the Shell was featured at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival
   == Origins of anime (early 1900s–1922) ==  According to Natsuki Matsumoto, the first animated film produced in Japan may have stemmed from as early as 1907
 Known as Katsudō Shashin (活動写真, "Activity Photo"), from its depiction of a boy in a sailor suit drawing the characters for katsudō shashin, the film was first found in 2005 
==========
 During the 1970s, the first generation of home consoles emerged, including the popular game Pong and various "clones"
 The 1970s was also the era of mainframe computer games
 The golden age of arcade video games was from 1978 to 1982
 Video arcades with large, graphics-decorated coin-operated machines were common at malls and popular, affordable home consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Intellivision enabled people to play games on their home TVs
 During the 1980s, gaming computers, early online gaming and handheld LCD games emerged; this era was affected by the video game crash of 1983

 It consists of fifty frames stencilled directly onto a strip of celluloid
 This claim has not been verified though and predates the first known showing of animated films in Japan
 The date and first film publicly displayed is another source of contention: while no Japanese-produced animation is definitively known to date before 1917, the possibility exists that other films entered Japan and that no known records have surfaced to prove a showing prior to 1912
 Film titles have surfaced over the years, but none have been proven to predate this year
 The first foreign animation is known to have been found in Japan in 1910, but it is not clear if the film was ever shown in a cinema or publicly displayed at all 
==========
 From 1976 to 1992, the second generation of video consoles emerged
 The third generation of consoles, which were 8-bit units, emerged from 1983 to 1995
 The fourth generation of consoles, which were 16-bit models, emerged from 1987 to 1999
 The 1990s saw the resurgence and decline of arcades, the transition to 3D video games, improved handheld games, and PC gaming
 The fifth generation of consoles, which were 32 and 64-bit units, was from 1993 to 2006

 Yasushi Watanabe found a film known as Fushigi no Bōrudo (不思議のボールド, "Miracle Board") in the records of the Yoshizawa Shōten (吉沢商店) company
 The description matches James Blackton's Humorous Phases of Funny Faces, though academic consensus on whether or not this is a true animated film is disputed
 According to Kyokko Yoshiyama, the first animated film called Nippāru no Henkei (ニッパールの変形, "Nippāru's Transformation") was shown in Japan at the Asakusa Teikokukan (浅草帝国館) in Tokyo sometime in 1911
 Yoshiyama did not refer to the film as "animation" though
 The first confirmed animated film shown in Japan was Les Exploits de Feu Follet by Émile Cohl on April 15, 1912 
==========
 During this era, mobile phone gaming emerged
 During the 2000s, the sixth generation of consoles emerged (1998–2013)
 During this period, online gaming and mobile games became major aspects of gaming culture
 The seventh generation of consoles was from 2005 to 2012
 This era was marked by huge development budgets for some games, with some having cinematic graphics; the launch of the top-selling Wii console, in which the user could control the game actions with real-life movement of the controller; the rise of casual PC games marketed to non-gamers; and the emergence of cloud computing in video games

 While speculation and other "trick films" have been found in Japan, it is the first recorded account of a public showing of a two-dimensional animated film in Japanese cinema
 During this time, German animations marketed for home release were distributed in Japan
Few complete animations made during the beginnings of Japanese animation have survived
 The reasons vary, but many are of commercial nature
 After the clips had been run, reels (being property of the cinemas) were sold to smaller cinemas in the country and then disassembled and sold as strips or single frames 
==========
 In 2013, the eighth generation of consoles emerged, including Nintendo's Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, Microsoft's Xbox One, and Sony's PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita
 PC gaming has been holding a large market share in Asia and Europe for decades and continues to grow due to digital distribution
 Since the development and widespread consumer use of smartphones, mobile gaming has been a driving factor for games, as they can reach people formerly uninterested in gaming, and those unable to afford or support dedicated hardware, such as video game consoles
   == Early history (1948–1970) ==  As early as 1950, computer scientists were using electronic machines to construct relatively simply game systems, such as Bertie the Brain in 1950 to play tic tac toe, or Nimrod in 1951 for playing Nim
 These systems used either electronic light displays and mainly as demonstration systems at large exhibitions to showcase the power of computers at the time

 The first anime that was produced in Japan was made sometime in 1917, but there it is disputed which title was the first to get that honour
 It has been confirmed that Dekobō Shingachō: Meian no Shippai (凸坊新画帳・名案の失敗, "Bumpy New Picture Book: Failure of a Great Plan") was made sometime during February 1917
 At least two unconfirmed titles were reported to have been made the previous month
The first anime short-films were made by three leading figures in the industry
 Ōten Shimokawa was a political caricaturist and cartoonist who worked for the magazine Tokyo Puck 
==========
Spacewar! is considered one of the first recognized video games
 Developed in 1961 for the PDP-1 mainframe computer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by a group of students there, it allowed two players to simulate a space combat fight on the PDP-1's relatively simplistic monitor
 The game's source code was shared with other institutions with a PDP-1 across the country as the MIT students themselves moved about, allowing the game to gain popularity
   == 1970s ==   === Birth of the video game industry (1971−1974) ===  In 1966, while working at Sanders Associates, Ralph Baer came up with an idea for an entertainment device that could be hooked up to a television monitor
 Presenting this to his superiors at Sanders and getting their approval, he along with William Harrison and William Rasch refined Baer's concept into the "Brown Box" prototype of a home video game console that could play a simple table tennis game
==========

None
 He was hired by Tenkatsu to do an animation for them
 Due to medical reasons, he was only able to do five movies, including Imokawa Mukuzo Genkanban no Maki (1917), before he returned to his previous work as a cartoonist
 Another prominent animator in this period was Jun'ichi Kōuchi
 He was a caricaturist and painter, who also had studied watercolour painting
 In 1912, he also entered the cartoonist sector and was hired for an animation by Kobayashi Shokai later in 1916 
==========
 The three patented the technology, and Sanders, not in the business of commercialization, sold licenses to the patents to Magnavox to commercialize
 With Baer's help, Magnavox developed the Magnavox Odyssey, the first commercial home console, in 1972
 While Baer was developing the Brown Box, Nolan Bushnell had the opportunity to see Spacewar! being run on Stanford University's system around 1969
 He told this to his coworker Ted Dabney and suggested they could build a coin-operated version of the game using a new low-cost small form-factor computer that had just been released commercially
 By 1971, the two had developed Computer Space, the first recognized arcade game, which was produced by Nutting Associates
==========

None
 He is viewed as the most technically advanced Japanese animator of the 1910s
 His works include around 15 movies
 The third was Seitaro Kitayama, an early animator who made animations on his own and was not hired by larger corporations
 He eventually founded his own animation studio, the Kitayama Eiga Seisakujo, which was later closed due to lack of commercial success
 He utilized the chalkboard technique, and later paper animation, with and without pre-printed backgrounds 
==========
  In 1972, Bushnell and Dabney decided to strike out on their own from Nutting and incorporated their preexisting partnership as Atari
  After seeing a demonstration of the Magnavox Odyssey ahead of its release, Bushnell charged new hire Allan Alcorn to create a version of that system's table tennis game as a practice project to familiarize himself with video game design
  Alcorn's version ended up being so fun that Atari decided to release it as Pong
  Available in limited quantities in late 1972, Pong began reaching the market in quantity in March 1973, after which it ignited a new craze for ball-and-paddle video games in the coin-operated amusement industry
  The success of Pong did not result in the displacement of traditional arcade amusements like pinball, but did lay the foundation for a successful video arcade game industry

 The works of these two latter pioneers include Namakura Gatana ("An Obtuse Sword", 1917) and a 1918 film Urashima Tarō which were believed to have been discovered together at an antique market in 2007
 However, this Urashima Tarō was later proved to most likely be a different film of the same story than the 1918 one by Kitayama, which, as of October 2017, remains undiscovered
   == Pre-war productions (1923–1939) == Yasuji Murata, Hakuzan Kimura, Sanae Yamamoto and Noburō Ōfuji were students of Kitayama Seitaro and worked at his film studio
 Kenzō Masaoka, another important animator, worked at a smaller animation studio
 In 1923, the Great Kantō earthquake destroyed most of the Kitayama studio and the residing animators spread out and founded studios of their own 
==========
  Roughly 70,000 video games, mostly ball-and-paddle variants, were sold in 1973 by a combination of recent startups like Atari, Ramtek, and Allied Leisure and established Chicago firms like Williams, Chicago Coin, and the Midway subsidiary of Bally Manufacturing
 The video arcade game market remained in a state of flux for the remainder of the decade
  The ball-and-paddle market collapsed in 1974 due to market saturation, which led to a significant drop in video game sales
  Smaller manufacturers attempted to compensate by creating "cocktail table" cabinets for sale to non-traditional venues like higher class restaurants and lounges, but this market failed to fully develop
  Larger companies like Atari and Midway turned to new genres to remain successful, especially racing games, one-on-one dueling games, and target shooting games

 Prewar animators faced several difficulties
 First, they had to compete with foreign producers such as Disney, which were influential on both audiences and producers
 Foreign films had already made a profit abroad, and could be undersold in the Japanese market, priced lower than what domestic producers needed to break even
 Japanese animators thus had to work cheaply, in small companies with only a handful of employees, which then made it difficult to compete in terms of quality with foreign product that was in color, with sound, and promoted by much bigger companies
 Until the mid-1930s, Japanese animation generally used cutout animation instead of cel animation because the celluloid was too expensive 
==========
  Early hits in these genres included Gran Trak 10 (1974) and Tank (1974) from Atari, and Wheels (1975), Gun Fight, (1975) and Sea Wolf (1976) from Midway
  Wheels and Gun Fight were licensed versions of Speed Race and Western Gun developed by the Taito Trading Company of Japan, marking the start of Japanese video game penetration into the United States
  Gun Fight was also one of the first arcade games to incorporate a microprocessor, starting a shift away from video arcade games engineered using dedicated TTL hardware to video games programmed in software
 The video game was one of several concepts that helped to reform the image of the arcade as a seedy hangout for delinquents
  This in turn aided the growth of arcades in suburban shopping malls
==========

None
 This resulted in animation that could seem derivative, flat (since motion forward and backward was difficult) and without detail
 But just as postwar Japanese animators were able to turn limited animation into a plus, so masters such as Yasuji Murata and Noburō Ōfuji were able to perform wonders that they made with cutout animation
 Animators such as Kenzo Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo, however, did attempt to bring Japanese animation up to the level of foreign work by introducing cel animation, sound, and technology such as the multiplane camera
 Masaoka created the first talkie anime, Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka, released in 1933, and the first anime made entirely using cel animation, The Dance of the Chagamas (1934)
 Seo was the first to use the multiplane camera in Ari-chan in 1941 
==========
  The principle pioneer of the shopping mall arcade was Jules Millman, who established an arcade in a shopping mall in Harvey, Illinois, in 1969
  By banning eating, drinking, and smoking, and maintaining a full staff at all times to keep an eye on the facilities, Millman created a safe environment where parents could feel safe leaving their older children while browsing other stores in the mall
  Millman founded American Amusements to establish more shopping mall arcades, which was purchased by Bally in 1974 and renamed Aladdin's Castle
  Other entrepreneur's imitated Millman's format, and arcades became a mainstay of the shopping mall by the end of the decade
 The emergence of solid state pinball in the late 1970s, in which electro-mechanical technologies like relays were replaced by the newly emerging microprocessor, temporarily stole the limelight from video games, which once again entered a period of decline in 1977 and 1978
==========

None
 Such innovations, however, were difficult to support purely commercially, so prewar animation depended considerably on sponsorship, as animators often concentrated on making PR films for companies, educational films for the government, and eventually works of propaganda for the military
 During this time, censorship and school regulations discouraged film-viewing by children, so anime that could possess educational value was supported and encouraged by the Monbusho (the Ministry of Education)
 This proved important for producers that had experienced obstacles releasing their work in regular theaters
 Animation had found a place in scholastic, political, and industrial use
   == During the second World War ==  In the 1930s, the Japanese government began enforcing cultural nationalism 
==========
  While individual games like Atari's Breakout (1976) and Cinematronics' Space Wars (1978) sold in large numbers during this period, overall profitability began to lag
  The market surged once again, however, after the introduction of the Taito game Space Invaders by Midway in 1979
   === First generation of home consoles and the Pong clones (1975–1977) ===  The Magnavox Odyssey never caught on with the public, due largely to the limited functionality of its primitive technology
 By the middle of the 1970s, however, the ball-and-paddle craze in the arcade had ignited public interest in video games and continuing advances in integrated circuits had resulted in large-scale integration (LSI) microchips cheap enough to be incorporated into a consumer product
  In 1975, Magnavox reduced the part count of the Odyssey using a three-chip set created by Texas Instruments and released two new systems that only played ball-and-paddle games, the Magnavox Odyssey 100 and Magnavox Odyssey 200
==========

None
 This also lead to a strict censorship and control of published media
 Many animators were urged to produce animations which enforced the Japanese spirit and national affiliation
 Some movies were shown in newsreel theaters, especially after the Film Law of 1939 promoted documentary and other educational films
 Such support helped boost the industry, as bigger companies formed through mergers and prompted major live-action studios such as Shochiku to begin producing animation
 It was at Shochiku that such masterworks as Kenzō Masaoka's Kumo to Chūrippu were produced 
==========
 Atari, meanwhile, entered the consumer market that same year with the single-chip Home Pong system designed by Harold Lee
  The next year, General Instrument released a "Pong-on-a-chip" LSI and made it available at a low price to any interested company
 Toy company Coleco Industries used this chip to create the million-selling Telstar console model series (1976–77), while dozens of other companies released models as well
  Overall, sales of dedicated ball-and-paddle systems in the U

 Wartime reorganization of the industry, however, merged the feature film studios into three big companies
 More animated films were commissioned by the military, showing the sly, quick Japanese people winning against enemy forces
 In 1941, Princess Iron Fan was made in China, as Asia's first full-length animated feature
 In 1943, Geijutsu Eigasha produced Mitsuyo Seo's Momotaro's Sea Eagles with help from the Navy
 Shochiku then made Japan's first full-length animated feature, Seo's Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors in 1945, again with the help of the Navy 
==========
 grew from 350,000 in 1975 to a peak of 5–6 million in 1977
 A similar boom hit the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe, with much of the market supplied by clone manufacturers in Hong Kong
 After 1977, the dedicated console market in the United States collapsed
 A new wave of programmable systems hit the market starting with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976 that offered the possibility of purchasing and playing a wider variety of games stored on cartridges containing mask ROM that could be plugged directly into the CPU of the console
 As older model dedicated consoles were heavily discounted and consumers with more purchasing power transitioned to the new programmable systems, newer dedicated systems with more advanced features like Video Pinball from Atari and the Magnavox Odyssey 4000 were squeezed out by their lower priced predecessors and their more sophisticated programmable replacements

None
   == Toei Animation and Mushi Production ==  Toei Animation and Mushi Production was founded and produced the first color anime feature film in 1958, Hakujaden (The Tale of the White Serpent, 1958)
 It was released in the US in 1961 as well as  Panda and the Magic Serpent
 After the success of the project, Toei released a new feature-length animation annually
Toei's style was characterized by an emphasis on each animator bringing his own ideas to the production
 The most extreme example of this is Isao Takahata's film Horus: Prince of the Sun (1968) 
==========
  This caused a brief dip in the market and the exit of industry leader Coleco, which failed to transition to programmable hardware
 Fairchild remained in the new programmable market alongside Atari and Magnavox, which released the VCS (1977) and Odyssey2 (1978) respectively
   === Mainframe computer games (1971–1979) ===  In the 1960s, a number of computer games were created for mainframe and minicomputer systems, but these failed to achieve wide distribution due to the continuing scarcity of computer resources, a lack of sufficiently trained programmers interested in crafting entertainment products, and the difficulty in transferring programs between computers in different geographic areas
  By the end of the 1970s, however, the situation had changed drastically
 The BASIC and C high-level programming languages were widely adopted during the decade, which were more accessible than earlier more technical languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL, opening up computer game creation to a larger base of users
==========

None
 Horus is often seen as the first major break from the normal anime style and the beginning of a later movement of "auteuristic" or "progressive anime" which would eventually involve directors such as Hayao Miyazaki (creator of Spirited Away) and Mamoru Oshii
A major contribution of Toei's style to modern anime was the development of the "money shot"
 This cost-cutting method of animation allows for emphasis to be placed on important shots by animating them with more detail than the rest of the work (which would often be limited animation)
 Toei animator Yasuo Ōtsuka began to experiment with this style and developed it further as he went into television
 In the 1980s, Toei would later lend its talent to companies like Sunbow Productions, Marvel Productions, DiC Entertainment, Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, Ruby Spears and Hanna Barbera, producing several animated cartoons for America during this period 
==========
  With the advent of time-sharing, which allowed the resources of a single mainframe to be parceled out among multiple users connected to the machine by terminals, computer access was no longer limited to a handful of individuals at an institution, creating more opportunities for students to create their own games
  Furthermore, the widespread adoption of the PDP-10, released by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1966, and the portable UNIX operating system, developed at Bell Labs in 1971 and released generally in 1973, created common programming environments across the country that reduced the difficulty of sharing programs between institutions
  Finally, the founding of the first magazines dedicated to computing like Creative Computing (1974), the publication of the earliest program compilation books like 101 BASIC Computer Games (1973), and the spread of wide-area networks such as the ARPANET allowed programs to be shared more easily across great distances
  As a result, many of the mainframe games created by college students in the 1970s influenced subsequent developments in the video game industry in ways that, Spacewar! aside, the games of the 1960s did not
 In the arcade and on home consoles, fast-paced action and real-time gameplay were the norm in genres like racing and target shooting
==========

None
 Other studios like TMS Entertainment, were also being used in the 1980s, which lead to Asian studios being used more often to animate foreign productions, but the companies involved still produced anime for their native Japan
Osamu Tezuka established Mushi Production in 1961, after Tezuka's contract with Toei Animation expired
 The studio pioneered TV animation in Japan, and was responsible for such successful TV series as Astro Boy, Kimba the White Lion, Gokū no Daibōken and Princess Knight
 Mushi Production also produced the first anime to be broadcast in the United States (on NBC in 1963), although Osamu Tezuka would complain about the restrictions on US television, and the alterations necessary for broadcast
   == 1960s == The 1960s brought anime to television and in America 
==========
  On the mainframe, however, such games were generally not possible due both to the lack of adequate displays (many computer terminals continued to rely on teletypes rather than monitors well into the 1970s and even most CRT terminals could only render character-based graphics) and insufficient processing power and memory to update game elements in real time
 While 1970s mainframes were more powerful than arcade and console hardware of the period, the need to parcel out computing resources to dozens of simultaneous users via time-sharing significantly hampered their abilities
  Thus, programmers of mainframe games focused on strategy and puzzle-solving mechanics over pure action
  Notable games of the period include the tactical combat game Star Trek (1971) by Mike Mayfield, the hide-and-seek game Hunt the Wumpus (1972) by Gregory Yob, and the strategic war game Empire (1977) by Walter Bright
  Perhaps the most significant game of the period was Colossal Cave Adventure (or simply Adventure), created in 1976 by Will Crowther by combining his passion for caving with concepts from the newly released tabletop role-playing game (RPG) Dungeons and Dragons (D&D)

 The first anime film to be broadcast was Three Tales in 1960

 Osamu Tezuka's Tetsuwan Atom (Astro Boy) is often miscredited as the first anime television series, premiering on January 1, 1963
 Astro Boy was highly influential to other anime in the 1960s, and was followed by a large number of anime about robots or space

 Mushi Pro continued to produce more anime television and met success with titles such as Kimba the White Lion in 1965
 What is noted as the first magical girl anime, Sally the Witch, began broadcasting in 1966
 The original Speed Racer anime television began in 1967 and was brought to the West with great success
 At the same time, an anime adaptation of Tezuka's Princess Knight aired, making it one of very few shoujo anime of the decade
 The first anime adaptation of Shotaro Ishinomori's manga Cyborg 009 was created in 1968, following the film adaptation two years prior 
==========
  Intended as an educational computer, the system connected hundreds of users all over the United States via remote terminals that featured high-quality plasma displays and allowed users to interact with each other in real time
  This allowed the system to host an impressive array of graphical and/or multiplayer games, including some of the earliest known computer RPGs, which were primarily derived, like Adventure, from D&D, but unlike that game placed a greater emphasis on combat and character progression than puzzle solving
  Starting with top-down dungeon crawls like The Dungeon (1975) and The Game of Dungeons (1975), more commonly referred to today by their filenames, pedit5 and dnd, PLATO RPGs soon transitioned to a first-person perspective with games like Moria (1975), Oubliette (1977), and Avatar (1979), which often allowed multiple players to join forces to battle monsters and complete quests together
  Like Adventure, these games ultimately inspired some of the earliest personal computer games

 coin-operated amusement industry, but their popularity was secondary to the industry stalwarts of pool and pinball
  That changed with the introduction of a new game developed in Japan
  While video games had been introduced to Japan soon after hitting the United States, the Japanese arcade industry had remained primarily focused on electro-mechanical driving and shooting games and a type of slot machine called the "medal game" that accepted and paid out in medals instead of currency so as not to be classified as a gambling game
  In 1977, the arrival of Breakout, distributed locally by the Nakamura Manufacturing Company, and the advent of table-top game units, pioneered by Taito, created new demand for video games in snack bars and tea houses

 This reduced Toei animation's staff and many animators went to studios such as A Pro and Telecom animation
 Mushi Production went bankrupt (though the studio was revived 4 years later), its former employees founding studios such as Madhouse and Sunrise
 Many young animators were thrust into the position of director, and the injection of young talent allowed for a wide variety of experimentation
 One of the earliest successful television productions in the early 1970s was Tomorrow's Joe (1970), a boxing anime which has become iconic in Japan
 1971 saw the first installment of the Lupin III anime 
==========
  Taito designer Tomohiro Nishikado decided to build on the popularity of Breakout by replacing the paddle in the game with a gun battery and the bricks in the game with rows of aliens that descended line-by-line while firing at the player
  Taito released this game in 1978 as Space Invaders
  Space Invaders introduced or popularized several important concepts in arcade video games, including play regulated by lives instead of a timer or set score, gaining extra lives through accumulating points, and the tracking of the high score achieved on the machine
  It was also the first game to confront the player with waves of targets that shot back at the player and the first to include background music during game play, albeit a simple four-note loop
  With its intense game play and competitive scoring features, Space Invaders became a national phenomenon as over 200,000 invader games—counting clones and knockoffs—entered Japanese game centers by the middle of 1979

 Contrary to the franchise's current popularity, the first series ran for 23 episodes before being cancelled
 The second series (starting in 1977) saw considerably more success, spanning 155 episodes over three years

 This show was originally a hard sell because it was a simple realistic drama aimed at children, and most TV networks thought children needed something more fantastic to draw them in
 Heidi was an international success, popular in many European countries, and so successful in Japan that it allowed for Hayao Miyazaki and Takahata to start a series of literary-based anime (World Masterpiece Theater) 
==========
 While not quite as popular in the United States, Space Invaders became the biggest hit the industry had seen since the Great Depression as Midway, serving as the North American manufacturer, moved over 60,000 cabinets
  The one-two punch of Space Invaders and the Atari game Asteroids (1979), which moved 70,000 units and popularized the recording of multiple high scores in a table, resulted in video arcade games completely displacing pinball and other amusements to become the central attraction of not just the shopping mall arcade, but also a variety of street locations from convenience stores to bowling alleys to pizza parlors
  Many of the best-selling games of 1980 and 1981 such as Galaxian (1979), Defender (1980), Missile Command (1980), Tempest (1981), and Galaga (1981) focused on shooting mechanics and achieving high scores
  Starting with Pac Man in 1980, which sold 96,000 units in the United States, a new wave of games appeared that focused on identifiable characters and alternate mechanics such as navigating a maze or traversing a series of platforms
  Aside from Pac Man and its sequel, Ms

 Miyazaki and Takahata left Nippon Animation in the late 1970s
 Two of Miyazaki's critically acclaimed productions during the 1970s were Future Boy Conan (1978) and Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro (1979)
 During this period, Japanese animation reached continental Europe with productions aimed at European and Japanese children, with the most-pronounced examples being the aforementioned Heidi but also Barbapapa and Vicky the Vikings
 Italy, Spain and France grew an interest in Japan's output, which was offered for a low price
Another genre known as mecha came into being at this time 
==========
 Pac-Man (1982), the most popular games in this vein were Donkey Kong (1981) and Q*bert (1982)
 According to trade publication Vending Times, revenues generated by coin-operated video games on location in the United States jumped from $308 million in 1978 to $968 million in 1979 to $2
8 billion in 1980
  As Pac Man ignited an even larger video game craze and attracted more female players to arcades, revenues jumped again to $4
9 billion in 1981

 Some early works include Mazinger Z (1972–1974), Science Ninja Team Gatchaman (1972–1974), Space Battleship Yamato (1974–75) and Mobile Suit Gundam (1979–80)
 As a contrast to the action-oriented shows, shows for a female audience such as Candy Candy and Rose of Versailles earned high popularity on Japanese television and later in other parts of the world
By 1978, over fifty shows were aired on television
   == 1980s == The shift towards space operas became more pronounced with the commercial success of Star Wars (1977)
 This allowed for the space opera Space Battleship Yamato (1974) to be revived as a theatrical film 
==========
  According to trade publication Play Meter, by July 1982, total coin-op collections peaked at $8
9 billion, of which $7
7 billion came from video games
  Meanwhile, the number of arcades—defined as any location with ten or more games—more than doubled between July 1981 and July 1983 from over 10,000 to just over 25,000
  These figures made arcade games the most popular entertainment medium in the country, far surpassing both pop music (at $4 billion in sales per year) and Hollywood films ($3 billion)

 Mobile Suit Gundam (1979) was also successful and revived as a theatrical film in 1982
 The success of the theatrical versions of Yamato and Gundam is seen as the beginning of the anime boom of the 1980s, and of "Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age"
A subculture in Japan, whose members later called themselves otaku, began to develop around animation magazines such as Animage and Newtype
 These magazines formed in response to the overwhelming fandom that developed around shows such as Yamato and Gundam in the late 1970s and early 1980s
 In the United States, the popularity of Star Wars had a similar, though much smaller, effect on the development of anime 
==========
   === Second generation consoles (1976–1982) ===  After the collapse of the dedicated console market in 1978, focus in the home shifted to the new programmable systems, in which game data was stored on ROM-based cartridges
  Fairchild semiconductor struck first in this market with the Channel F, but after losing millions in the digital watch business, the company took a conservative approach to the programmable console market and kept production runs of the system low
  As a result, by the end of 1977, Fairchild had only sold about 250,000 systems
  Atari followed Fairchild into the market in 1977 and sold between 340,000 and 400,000 systems that year
  Magnavox joined the programmable market in 1978 with the Odyssey2, while toy company Mattel released the Intellivision in 1979, which featured graphics superior to any of its competitors

 Gatchaman was reworked and edited into Battle of the Planets in 1978 and again as G-Force in 1986
 Space Battleship Yamato was reworked and edited into Star Blazers in 1979
 The Macross series began with The Super Dimension Fortress Macross (1982), which was adapted into English as the first arc of Robotech (1985), which was created from three separate anime titles: The Super Dimension Fortress Macross, Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross and Genesis Climber Mospeada
 The sequel to Mobile Suit Gundam, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam (1985), became the most successful real robot space opera in Japan, where it managed an average television rating of 6

==========
 After both Atari and Fairchild made a strong showing in 1977, the market hit a difficult patch in 1978 when retailers resisted building inventory, believing that the newly emerging electronic handheld market would displace video games
  Atari, for example, manufactured 800,000 systems, but proved unable to sell more than 500,000 to retail
  This helped precipitate a crisis at the company that saw co-founder and chairman Nolan Bushnell and president Joe Keenan forced out by Atari's parent company, Warner Communications, which had purchased Atari in 1976 largely on the potential of the VCS
  Ultimately, home video games did well in the 1978 holiday season, and retailers proved more amenable to stocking them again in 1979
  New Atari CEO Ray Kassar subsequently harnessed his company's leftover stock to help transform video game consoles into a year-round product rather than something just purchased by retailers for sale during the holiday season

The otaku subculture became more pronounced with Mamoru Oshii's adaptation of Rumiko Takahashi's popular manga Urusei Yatsura (1981)
 Yatsura made Takahashi a household name and Oshii would break away from fan culture and take a more auteuristic approach with his 1984 film Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer
 This break with the otaku subculture would allow Oshii to experiment further
 The otaku subculture had some effect on people who were entering the industry around this time 
==========
 The real breakthrough for the home video game market occurred in 1980 when Atari released a conversion of the popular Space Invaders game for the VCS, which was licensed from Taito
  Buoyed by the success of the game, Atari's consumer sales almost doubled from $119 million to nearly $204 million in 1980 and then exploded to over $841 million in 1981, while sales across the entire video game industry in the United States rose from $185
7 million in 1979 to just over $1 billion in 1981
  Through a combination of conversions of its own arcade games like Missile Command and Asteroids and licensed conversions like Defender, Atari took a commanding lead in the industry, with an estimated 65% market share of the worldwide industry by dollar volume by 1981
  Mattel settled into second place with roughly 15%-20% of the market, while Magnavox ran a distant third, and Fairchild exited the market entirely in 1979

 The most famous of these people were the amateur production group Daicon Films which would become Gainax
 Gainax began by making films for the Daicon science fiction conventions and were so popular in the otaku community that they were given a chance to helm the biggest-budgeted anime film (at that time), Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise (1987)
  One of the most-influential anime of all time, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984), was made during this period
 The film gave extra prestige to anime allowing for many experimental and ambitious projects to be funded shortly after its release
 It also allowed director Hayao Miyazaki and his longtime colleague Isao Takahata to create their own studio under the supervision of former Animage editor Toshio Suzuki 
==========
 In the early days of the programmable market, all of the games for a given system were developed by the firm that released the console
  That changed in 1979 when four Atari programmers, seeking greater recognition and financial reward for their contributions, struck out on their own to form Activision, the first third-party developer
  The company went on to develop a string of hits including Kaboom! (1981), River Raid (1982), and Pitfall! (1982), recognized as one of the foundational games of the scrolling platformer genre
  In 1981, another group of Atari employees joined with ex-Mattel staff to form Imagic and experienced success with games like Demon Attack (1982) and Atlantis (1982)
 In 1982, Atari released a more advanced console based on its 8-bit computer line, the Atari 5200, which failed to perform as well as its predecessor

 This studio would become known as Studio Ghibli and its first film was Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), one of Miyazaki's most-ambitious films
 The success of Dragon Ball (1986) introduced the martial arts genre and became incredibly influential in the Japanese Animation industry
 It influenced many more martial arts anime and manga series' including YuYu Hakusho (1990), One Piece (1999), Naruto (2002), and One Punch Man (2015)
 The 1980s brought anime to the home video market in the form of original video animation (OVA)
 The first OVA was Mamoru Oshii's Dallos (1983–1984) 
==========
  That same year, Coleco returned to the video game market with a new console, the ColecoVision, that featured near-arcade-quality graphics and shipped with a port of the popular arcade game Donkey Kong
  Coleco sold out its entire run of 550,000 units in the 1982 holiday season as overall U

 Shows such as Patlabor had their beginnings in this market and it proved to be a way to test less-marketable animation against audiences
 The OVA allowed for the release of pornographic anime such as Cream Lemon (1984); the first hentai OVA was actually the little-known Wonder Kids studio's Lolita Anime, also released in 1984
 The 1980s also saw the amalgamation of anime with video games
 The airing of Red Photon Zillion (1987) and subsequent release of its companion game, is considered to have been a marketing ploy by Sega to promote sales of their newly released Master System in Japan
 Sports anime, as it is now known, made its debut in 1983 with an anime adaptation of Yoichi Takahashi's soccer manga Captain Tsubasa, which became the first worldwide successful sports anime 
==========
  Ultimately, however, the rapid growth of the home console market could not be sustained, and the industry soon faced a serious downturn that would nearly wipe it out during the video game crash of 1983
   === Early home computer games (1976–1982) === While the fruit of retail development in early video games appeared mainly in video arcades and home consoles, home computers began appearing in the late 1970s and were rapidly evolving in the 1980s, allowing their owners to program simple games
 Hobbyist groups for the new computers soon formed and PC game software followed
 Soon many of these games—at first clones of mainframe classics such as Star Trek, and then later ports or clones of popular arcade games such as Space Invaders, Frogger, Pac-Man (see Pac-Man clones) and Donkey Kong—were being distributed through a variety of channels, such as printing the game's source code in books (such as David Ahl's BASIC Computer Games), magazines (Creative Computing), and newsletters, which allowed users to type in the code for themselves
 Early game designers like Crowther, Daglow and Yob found the computer code for their games—which they had never thought to copyright—published in books and magazines, with their names removed from the listings

None
 Its themes and stories were a formula that would be used in many sports series that followed, such as Slam Dunk, Prince of Tennis and Eyeshield 21
 The late 1980s saw an increasing number of high-budget and experimental films
 In 1985, Toshio Suzuki helped put together funding for Oshii's experimental film Angel's Egg (1985)
 Theatrical releases became more ambitious, each film trying to outclass or outspend its predecessors, taking cues from Nausicaä's popular and critical success
 Night on the Galactic Railroad (1985), Tale of Genji (1986), and Grave of the Fireflies (1988) were all ambitious films based on important literary works in Japan 
==========
 Early home computers from Apple, Commodore, Tandy and others had many games that people typed in
 Games were also distributed by the physical mailing and selling of floppy disks, cassette tapes, and ROM cartridges
 Soon a small cottage industry was formed, with amateur programmers selling disks in plastic bags put on the shelves of local shops or sent through the mail
 Richard Garriott distributed several copies of his 1980 role-playing video game Akalabeth: World of Doom in plastic bags before the game was published
   == 1980s ==  The video games industry experienced its first major growing pains in the early 1980s as publishing houses appeared, with many businesses surviving 20+ years, such as Electronic Arts—alongside fly-by-night operations that cheated the games' developers

 Films such as Char's Counterattack (1988) and Arion (1986) were lavishly budgeted spectacles
 This period of lavish budgeting and experimentation would reach its zenith with two of the most-expensive anime film productions ever: Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise (1987) and Akira (1988)
 Studio Ghibli's Kiki's Delivery Service (1989) was the top-grossing film for 1989, earning over $40 million at the box office
 Despite the commercial failure of Akira in Japan, it brought with it a much larger international fan base for anime
 When shown overseas, the film became a cult hit and, eventually, a symbol of the medium for the West 
==========
 While some early 1980s games were simple clones of existing arcade titles, the relatively low publishing costs for personal computer games allowed for bold, unique games
   === Gaming computers === Following the success of the Apple II and Commodore PET in the late 1970s, a series of cheaper and incompatible rivals emerged in the early 1980s
 This second batch included the Commodore VIC-20 and 64; Sinclair ZX80, ZX81 and ZX Spectrum; NEC PC-8000, PC-6001, PC-88 and PC-98; Sharp X1 and X68000; and Atari 8-bit family, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Amstrad CPC, and MSX series
 These rivals helped to catalyze both the home computer and game markets, by raising awareness of computing and gaming through their competing advertising campaigns
 The Sinclair, Acorn and Amstrad offerings were generally only known in Europe and Africa, the NEC and Sharp offerings were generally only known in Asia, and the MSX had a base in South America, Europe, Middle East and Asia, while the US-based Apple, Commodore and Atari offerings were sold in both the US and Europe

 The domestic failure and international success of Akira, combined with the bursting of the bubble economy and Osamu Tezuka's death in 1989, brought a close to the 1980s era of anime
   == 1990s == In 1995, Hideaki Anno wrote and directed the controversial anime Neon Genesis Evangelion
 This show became popular in Japan among anime fans and became known to the general public through mainstream media attention
 It is believed that Anno originally wanted the show to be the ultimate otaku anime, designed to revive the declining anime industry, but midway through production he also made it into a heavy critique of the subculture
 It culminated in the successful but controversial film The End of Evangelion which grossed over $10 million in 1997 
==========
 Games dominated home computers' software libraries
 A 1984 compendium of reviews of Atari 8-bit software used 198 pages for games compared to 167 for all others
 By that year the computer gaming market took over from the console market following the crash of that year; computers offered equal gaming ability and, since their simple design allowed games to take complete command of the hardware after power-on, they were nearly as simple to start playing with as consoles
  The Commodore 64 was released to the public in August 1982
 It found initial success because it was marketed and priced aggressively

 The many violent and sexual scenes in Evangelion caused TV Tokyo to increase censorship of anime content
 As a result, when Cowboy Bebop was first broadcast in 1998, it was shown heavily edited and only half the episodes were aired; it too gained heavy popularity both in and outside of Japan
 Evangelion started a series of so-called "post-Evangelion" or "organic" mecha shows
 Most of these were giant robot shows with some kind of religious or complex plot
 These include RahXephon, Brain Powerd, and Gasaraki 
==========
 It had a BASIC programming environment, and advanced graphic and sound abilities for its time, similar to the ColecoVision console
 It also used the same game controller ports popularized by the Atari 2600, allowing gamers to use their old joysticks with the system
 It became the most popular home computer of its day in the United States and, internationally, the best-selling single computer model of all time
 At around the same time, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum was released in the United Kingdom and quickly became the most popular home computer in many areas of Western Europe—and later the Eastern Bloc—due to the ease with which clones could be produced
 A number of prominent video game developers emerged in Britain in the late 1970s and early 1980s
==========

None
 It also led to late-night experimental anime shows
 Starting with Serial Experiments Lain (1998), late night became a forum for experimental anime such as Boogiepop Phantom (2000), Texhnolyze (2003) and Paranoia Agent (2004)
 Experimental anime films were also released in the 1990s, most notably the cyberpunk thriller Ghost in the Shell (1995), which had a strong influence on The Matrix
 Ghost in the Shell, alongside Evangelion and the neo-noir space western Cowboy Bebop, helped further increase the awareness of anime in international markets
The late 1990s also saw a brief revival of the super robot genre that had decreased in popularity due to the rise of real robot and psychological mecha shows like Gundam, Macross, and Evangelion 
==========
In 2008 Sid Meier listed the IBM PC as one of the three most important innovations in the history of video games
 The IBM PC compatible platform became a technically competitive gaming platform with IBM's PC/AT in 1984
 The primitive CGA graphics of prior models, with only 4-color 320×200 pixel graphics (or, using special programming, 16-color 160×100 graphics) had limited the PC's appeal to the business segment, as its graphics failed to compete with the C64 or Apple II
 The new 64-color Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) display standard allowed its graphics to approach the quality seen in popular home computers like the Commodore 64
 However, the sound abilities of the AT were still limited to the PC speaker, which was substandard compared to the built-in sound chips used in many home computers
==========

None
 The revival of the super robot genre began with Brave Exkaiser in 1990, and led to remakes and sequels of 1970s super robot shows like Getter Robo Go and Tetsujin-28 go FX
 There were very few popular super robot shows produced after this, until Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann in 2007
 Alongside its super robot counterpart, the real robot genre was also declining during the 1990s
 Though several Gundam shows were produced during this decade, very few of them were successful
 The only Gundam shows in the 1990s which managed an average television rating over 4% in Japan were Mobile Fighter G Gundam (1994) and New Mobile Report Gundam Wing (1995) 
==========
 Also, the relatively high cost of the PC compatible systems severely limited their popularity in gaming
 The Apple Macintosh also arrived at this time
 It lacked the color abilities of the earlier Apple II, instead preferring a much higher pixel resolution, but the operating system support for the graphical user interface (GUI) attracted developers of some games (e
g
 Lode Runner) even before color returned in 1987 with the Mac II

 It wasn't until Mobile Suit Gundam SEED in 2002 that the real robot genre regained its popularity
  In 1997, Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke became the most-expensive anime film up until that time, costing $20 million to produce
 Miyazaki personally checked each of the 144,000 cels in the film, and is estimated to have redrawn parts of 80,000 of them
 1997 was also the year of Satoshi Kon's debut, Perfect Blue, which won "Best Film" and "Best Animation" awards at Montreal's 1997 Fantasia Festival, It also won awards in Portugal's Fantasporto Film Festival
 By 1998, over one hundred anime shows were aired on television in Japan, including a popular series based on the Pokémon video game franchise 
==========
 The arrival of the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga in 1985 was the start of a new era of 16-bit machines
 For many users they were too costly until later on in the decade, at which point advances in the IBM PC's open platform had caused the IBM PC compatibles to become comparably powerful at a lower cost than their competitors
 The VGA standard developed for the new IBM Personal System/2 (PS/2) line in 1987 gave the PC the potential for 256-color graphics
 This was a big jump ahead of most 8-bit home computers but still lagged behind platforms with built-in sound and graphics hardware like the Amiga
 This caused an odd trend around '89–91 toward developing for a seemingly inferior machine
==========

None
 Other 1990s anime series which gained international success were Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, and Digimon; the success of these shows brought international recognition to the martial arts superhero genre, the magical girl genre, and the action-adventure genre, respectively
 In particular, Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon were dubbed into more than a dozen languages worldwide
 Another large success was the anime One Piece, based on the best-selling manga of all time, which is still ongoing
   == 2000s == The "Evangelion-era" trend continued into the 2000s with Evangelion-inspired mecha anime such as RahXephon (2002) and Zegapain (2006) – RahXephon was also intended to help revive 1970s-style mecha designs
 The real robot genre (including the Gundam and Macross franchises), which had declined during the 1990s, was revived in the early 2000s with the success of shows such as FLCL (2000), Mobile Suit Gundam SEED (2002), Eureka Seven (2005), Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (2006), Mobile Suit Gundam 00 (2007), and Macross Frontier (2008) 
==========
 Thus while both the ST and Amiga were host to many technically excellent games, their time of prominence was shorter than that of the 8-bit machines, which saw new ports well into the 1980s and even the 1990s
  Dedicated sound cards started to address the issue of poor sound abilities in IBM PC compatibles in the late 1980s
 Ad Lib set an early de facto standard for sound cards in 1987, with its card based on the Yamaha YM3812 sound chip
 This lasted until the introduction of Creative Labs' Sound Blaster in 1989, which took the chip and added new features while remaining compatible with Ad Lib cards, and creating a new de facto standard
 However, many games still supported these and rarer things like the Roland MT-32 and Disney Sound Source into the early 1990s

The 1970s-style super robot genre revival began with GaoGaiGar in 1997 and continued into the 2000s, with several remakes of classic series such as Getter Robo and Dancougar, as well as original titles created in the super robot mold like Godannar and Gurren Lagann
 Gurren Lagann in particular combined the super robot genre with elements from 1980s real robot shows, as well as 1990s "post-Evangelion" shows
 Gurren Lagann received both the "best television production" and "best character design" awards from the Tokyo International Anime Fair in 2008
 This eventually culminated in the release of Shin Mazinger in 2009, a full-length revival of the first super robot series, Mazinger Z
 An art movement started by Takashi Murakami that combined Japanese pop-culture with postmodern art called Superflat began around this time 
==========
 The initial high cost of sound cards meant they did not find widespread use until the 1990s
 Shareware gaming first appeared in the mid-1980s, but its big successes came in the 1990s
   === Early online gaming ===  Dial-up bulletin board systems were popular in the 1980s, and sometimes used for online game playing
 The earliest such systems were in the late 1970s and early 1980s and had a crude plain-text interface
 Later systems made use of terminal-control codes (the so-called ANSI art, which included the use of IBM-PC-specific characters not part of an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard) to get a pseudo-graphical interface

None
 Murakami asserts that the movement is an analysis of post-war Japanese culture through the eyes of the otaku subculture
 His desire is also to get rid of the categories of 'high' and 'low' art making a flat continuum, hence the term 'superflat'
 His art exhibitions have gained popularity overseas and have influenced a handful of anime creators, particularly those from Studio 4 °C
The experimental late night anime trend popularized by Serial Experiments Lain also continued into the 2000s with experimental anime such as Boogiepop Phantom (2000), Texhnolyze (2003), Paranoia Agent (2004), Gantz (2004), and Ergo Proxy (2006) In addition to these experimental trends, the 2000s were also characterized by an increase of moe-style art and bishōjo and bishōnen character design
 There was a rising presence and popularity of genres such as romance, harem and slice of life 
==========
 Some BBSs offered access to various games which were playable through such an interface, ranging from text adventures to gambling games like blackjack (generally played for "points" rather than real money)
 On some multiuser BBSs (where more than one person could be online at once), there were games allowing users to interact with one another
 SuperSet Software created Snipes, a text-mode networked computer game in 1983 to test a new IBM Personal Computer–based computer network and demonstrate its abilities
 Snipes is officially credited as being the original inspiration for NetWare
 It is believed to be the first network game ever written for a commercial personal computer and is recognized alongside 1974 game Maze War (a networked multiplayer maze game for several research machines) and Spasim (a 3D multiplayer space simulation for time shared mainframes) as the precursor to multiplayer games such as 1987's MIDI Maze, and Doom in 1993

 Anime based on eroge and visual novels increased in popularity in the 2000s, building on a trend started in the late 1990s by such works as Sentimental Journey (1998) and To Heart (1999)
 Examples of such works include Green Green (2003), SHUFFLE! (2006), Kanon (2002 and 2006), Fate/Stay Night (2006), Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (2006), Ef: A Tale of Memories (2007), True Tears (2008), and Clannad (2008 and 2009)
 Many shows have been adapted from manga and light novels, including popular titles such as Yu-Gi-Oh! (2000), Inuyasha (2000), Naruto and Naruto Shippuden(2002 and 2007), Fullmetal Alchemistand the manga-likeFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood(2003 and 2009), Monster(2004), Bleach(2004), Rozen Maiden(2005), Aria the Animation(2005), Shakugan no Shana(2005), Pani Poni Dash!(2005), Death Note(2006), Mushishi(2006), Sola(2007), The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya(2006), Lucky Star(2007), Toradora!(2008–09), K-On!(2009), Bakemonogatari(2009), andFairy Tail (2009); these shows typically last several years and achieve large fanbases
 Nevertheless, original anime titles continue to be produced with the same success
 The 2000s marked a trend of emphasis of the otaku subculture

  In 1995 iDoom (later Kali
net) was created for games that only allowed local network play to connect over the internet
  Other services such as Kahn, TEN, Mplayer, and Heat

net, WON and later Steam
 The first user interfaces were plain-text—similar to BBSs— but they operated on large mainframe computers, permitting larger numbers of users to be online at once
 By the end of the decade, inline services had fully graphical environments using software specific to each personal computer platform
 Popular text-based services included CompuServe, The Source, and GEnie, while platform-specific graphical services included PlayNET and Quantum Link for the Commodore 64, AppleLink for the Apple II and Macintosh, and PC Link for the IBM PC—all of which were run by the company which eventually became America Online—and a competing service, Prodigy
 Interactive games were a feature of these services, though until 1987 they used text-based displays, not graphics

 The first concentrated effort came from Fuji TV's Noitamina block
 The 30-minute late-Thursday timeframe was created to showcase productions for young women of college age, a demographic that watches very little anime
 The first production Honey and Clover was a particular success, peaking at a 5% TV rating in Kantou, very strong for late-night anime
 The block has been running uninterrupted since April 2005 and has yielded many successful productions unique in the modern anime market
 There have been revivals of American cartoons such as Transformers which spawned four new series, Transformers: Car Robots in 2000, Transformers: Micron Legend in 2003, Transformers: Superlink in 2004, and Transformers: Galaxy Force in 2005

   === Handheld LCD games === In 1979, Milton Bradley Company released the first handheld system using interchangeable cartridges, Microvision
 While the handheld received modest success in the first year of production, the lack of games, screen size and video game crash of 1983 brought about the system's quick demise
In 1980, Nintendo released its Game & Watch line, handheld electronic game which spurred dozens of other game and toy companies to make their own portable games, many of which were copies of Game & Watch titles or adaptations of popular arcade games
 Improving LCD technology meant the new handhelds could be more reliable and consume fewer batteries than LED or VFD games, most only needing watch batteries
 They could also be made much smaller than most LED handhelds, even small enough to wear on one's wrist like a watch

 In addition, an anime adaptation of the G
I Joe series was produced titled G

 Joe: Sigma 6
 The revival of earlier anime series was seen in the forms of Fist of the North Star: The Legends of the True Savior (2006) and Dragon Ball Z Kai (2009)

 Tiger Electronics borrowed this concept of videogaming with cheap, affordable handhelds and still produces games in this model to the present day
   === Video game crash of 1983 ===  At the end of 1983, several factors, including a market flooded with poor-quality games, the commercial failure of several important Atari 2600 titles, and home computers emerging as a new and more advanced gaming platform, caused the industry to experience a severe downturn
 This was the "crash" of the video game industry
 It bankrupted several companies that produced North American consoles and games from late 1983 to early 1984
 It ended what is considered to be the second generation of console video gaming

 Later series also started receiving revivals in the late 2000s and early 2010s, such as with Studio Khara's Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy (2007–), and new adaptations of Masamune Shirow's manga Appleseed XIII (2011) and Ghost in the Shell: Arise (2013–2016)
 The decade also dawned a revival of high-budget feature-length anime films, such as Millennium Actress (2001), Metropolis (2001), Appleseed (2001), Paprika (2006), and the most expensive of all being Steamboy (2004) which cost $26 million to produce
 Satoshi Kon established himself alongside Otomo and Oshii as one of the premier directors of anime film, before his premature death at the age of 46
 Other younger film directors, such as Mamoru Hosoda, director of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2006) and Summer Wars (2009), also began to reach prominence
 During this decade, anime feature films were nominated for and won major international film awards for the first time in the industry's history 
==========
 As a result of the crash, a globally important video gaming industry emerged in Japan, creating important room for companies like Nintendo and Sega
 This brought about the worldwide popularity of the third-generation Nintendo Entertainment System, for which third-party game publishing was strictly overseen by Nintendo
   === Third generation consoles (1983–1995) (8-bit) ===  Whilst a broken gaming industry in the US took several local businesses to bankruptcy and practically ended retail interest in video gaming products, an 8-bit third generation of video game consoles started in Japan as early as 1983 with the release of both Nintendo's Family Computer ("Famicom") and Sega's SG-1000 on July 15
 The first clearly trumped the second in terms of commercial success in the country, causing Sega to replace it, two years later, by a severely improved and modernized version called the Sega Mark III
In efforts to make the Famicom marketable in the US, Nintendo created a completely redesigned version of it, called the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), to be sold in the country as a product unrelated to video gaming

 In 2002, Spirited Away, a Studio Ghibli production directed by Hayao Miyazaki, won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival and in 2003 at the 75th Academy Awards it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature
 It was the first non-American film to win the award and is one of only two to do so
 It has also become the highest grossing anime film, with a worldwide box office of US$274 million
 Following the launch of Toonami on Cartoon Network and later Adult Swim, anime saw a giant rise in the North American market
 Kid-friendly anime such as Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Digimon, Doraemon, Bakugan, Beyblade, and the 4Kids Entertainment adaptation of One Piece have all received varying levels of success 
==========
 For this same reason, the company also developed a toy robot accessory called the R
O
B
 to be sold together with some versions
 The NES was released on 18 October 1985 in the US, reviving the video game market in the country and proving successful to the American audience, peaking in popularity between 1987 and the early 1990s

 This era also saw the rise of anime-influenced animation, most notably Avatar: the Last Airbender and its sequel The Legend of Korra, Ben 10, Chaotic, Samurai Jack, The Boondocks, RWBY and Teen Titans
 At the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, directed by Mamoru Oshii, was in competition for the Palme d'Or and in 2006, at the 78th Academy Awards, Howl's Moving Castle, another Studio Ghibli-produced film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, was nominated for Best Animated Feature
 5 Centimeters Per Second, directed by Makoto Shinkai, won the inaugural Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film in 2007, and so far, anime films have been nominated for the award every year
 By 2004, over two hundred shows were aired on television
   == 2010s == In May 2012, the Toonami block in the US was relaunched as an adult-oriented action block on Adult Swim, bringing uncut anime to a far wider audience 
==========
 The console was later released in other Western countries, but because of heavy competition from home computers such as the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64, and a lack of marketing, the NES was prevented from having as much success in Europe
The Sega Mark III, released to Western consumers as the Master System, dominated the markets of Europe, Oceania and Brazil, selling more than the NES in these regions
 Soon, the Famicom/NES and the Master System became the great consoles of the third generation
 While Sega focused on unique gameplay experiences and innovative technology (with Master System's superior technical properties which allowed better graphics, and accessories like LCD glasses), Nintendo focused on creating long and popular game franchises which often repeated the same features
 Despite different regional dominances, the Famicom/NES sold a superior sum of 61

 In addition to re-releasing older shows, the block (as well as Adult Swim itself) oversees the premiere of English dubbed releases for various new shows, including: Durarara!! (2010), Deadman Wonderland (2011), Hunter x Hunter (2011), Sword Art Online (2012), JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012), Attack on Titan (2013), Kill la Kill (2013), Space Dandy (2014), Akame ga Kill!

 Stone (2019), and Fire Force (2019)
On September 6, 2013 Hayao Miyazaki announced that The Wind Rises (2013) would be his last film, and on August 3, 2014 it was announced that Studio Ghibli was "temporarily halting production" following the release of When Marnie Was There (2014), further substantiating the finality of Miyazaki's retirement
 The disappointing sales of Isao Takahata's comeback film The Tale of Princess Kaguya (2013) has also been cited as a factor
 Several prominent staffers, including producer Yoshiaki Nishimura and director Hiromasa Yonebayashi, left to form their own Studio Ponoc, premièring with Mary and the Witch's Flower (2017)

91 million worldwide copies, against 14

In this generation, the gamepad or joypad, took over for joysticks, paddles, and keypads as the default game controller
 The gamepad design of an 8 direction Directional-pad (or D-pad for short) with 2 or more action buttons became the standard
 This generation also marked a shift in the dominance of home video game console hardware and console game production from the United States to Japan

 Both Ghibli and Miyazaki subsequently went back into production for the up-coming film How Do You Live?, while Takahata died on April 5, 2018 of lung cancer
Additionally, various international anime distribution companies, such as ADV Films, Bandai Entertainment, and Geneon Entertainment, were shut down due to poor revenue, with their assets spun into new companies like Sentai Filmworks or given to other companies
In 2011, Puella Magi Madoka Magica was aired in Japan
 The anime was a change from normal magical girl anime, as this anime contained more darker, complex and more gorier themes than magical anime usually would
 The anime got great reception from critics, as United Kingdom's Anime Network's Andy Hanley rated it a 10 out of 10 for its emotional content and evocative soundtrack 
==========
The third console generation marked the debut of various high-profile role-playing franchises, such as The Legend of Zelda, Dragon Quest, Phantasy Star and Final Fantasy, the latter of which financially saved Japanese developer Square
 1987 saw the birth of the stealth genre with Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear series' first game, on the MSX2 computer
 In 1989, Capcom released Sweet Home on the NES, which served as a precursor to the survival horror genre
 In 1988, Nintendo published their first issue of Nintendo Power magazine
 By 1989 the market for cartridge-based console games was more than $2 billion, while that for disk-based computer games was less than $300 million

 Both Attack on Titan and The Wind Rises reflect a national debate surrounding the reinterpretation of Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan, with Miyazaki's pacifism in the film coming under fire from the political right, while Attack on Titan has been accused of promoting militarism by people in neighboring Asian countries, despite being intended to show the haunting, hopeless aspects of conflict
 The mecha anime genre (as well as Japanese kaiju films) received a Western homage with the 2013 film Pacific Rim directed by Guillermo del Toro
Western streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime are increasingly becoming involved in the production and licensing of anime
In 2015, an all record-high of three hundred forty anime series aired on television

 Large computer-game companies such as Epyx, Electronic Arts, and LucasArts began devoting much or all of their attention on console games
 Computer Gaming World warned that computer gaming could become a "cultural backwater," similar to what had happened a few years earlier with 8-bit computers
 In 1990, Commodore and Amstrad entered the console market with their C64GS and GX4000 game machines respectively
 These were both based on the 8-bit computers of their manufacturers, and had only limited success due to a lack of software support and the arrival of 16-bit machines
 Amstrad's GX4000 sold just over 15,000 units, with only 25 officially released game cartridges

   === Fourth generation consoles (1987–2004) (16-bit) ===  A 16-bit generation of video game consoles starts in the late 1980s
 The TurboGrafx-16, named the PC Engine in Europe and Japan, debuted in 1987 as the first commercial 16-bit game system
 It had a large following in Japan, but, did poorly in North America and Europe because of its limited library of games and because of excessive distribution restrictions imposed by Hudson Soft

 Sega's Mega Drive/Genesis sold well worldwide early on after its debut in 1988
 Nintendo responded with its own next generation system named the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), in 1990
  This time was one of intense competition and not entirely truthful marketing
 The TurboGrafx-16 was billed as the first 16-bit system but its central processor was an 8-bit HuC6280, with only its HuC6270 graphics processor being a true 16-bit chip
 Also, the much earlier Mattel Intellivision contained a 16-bit processor

 In Japan, the PC Engine was a very successful competitor against the Famicom and a CD drive peripheral allowed it to fend off the Mega Drive in 1988, though it never really caught on to the same degree outside Japan
 The PC Engine eventually lost out to the Super Famicom, but, due to its popular CD add-ons, retained enough of a user base to support new games well into the late 1990s

 CD-ROM drives were introduced in this generation, as add-ons for the PC Engine in 1988 and the Mega Drive in 1991
 Nintendo experimented with optical media formats for the SNES in a joint venture with Sony, who developed this concept into the PlayStation and rose to prominence as a major competitor to Nintendo and Sega
 Basic 3D graphics entered the mainstream with flat-shaded polygons enabled by added processors in game cartridges like Virtua Racing and Star Fox, while the Mega Drive managed to produce such graphics without special processors, on the ≈8 MHz 68000 chip by using highly simplified polygon models, a slow frame rate (<4 fps), and reduced resolution
 Sonic the Hedgehog, released in 1991 for the Mega Drive/Genesis, gave the console mainstream popularity, and rivaled Nintendo's Mario franchise, starting the so-called "console war
" Its namesake character became the mascot of Sega and one of the most recognizable video game characters in history

 SNK's Neo-Geo was the most costly console by a wide margin when released in 1990, and remained so for years
 Its 2D graphics were of a quality years ahead of other consoles
 The reason for this was that it contained the same hardware that was found in SNK's arcade games
 This was the first time since the home Pong machines that a true-to-the-arcade experience could be had at home, but the system was commercially inviable
 This era also saw a revival of handheld consoles, which were absent in the prior generation

 Nintendo's Game Boy, a portable released in 1989 with monochromatic 2D graphics and 35-hours battery life, became widely popular in the world and sold much more than its three competitors, the Atari Lynx, Sega's Game Gear and NEC's Turbo Express, released in Japan in North America until 1991
 Despite these three consoles having much more sophisticated 16-bit graphics (similar to home consoles of the time), they had limited battery life
 The other consoles also had scarce game libraries compared to over one thousand games released for the Game Boy, including best-selling titles Pokémon Red and Blue, and which inspired an entire line of portable machines that continued through the following two generations
   == 1990s ==  The 1990s were a decade of marked innovation in video gaming
 It was a decade of transition from raster graphics to 3D graphics and gave rise to several genres of video games including first-person shooter, real-time strategy, and MMO
